    This mod assistant allows
    [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) for you project.
    Your project has to be already on GitHub.
    
    Run `da mod travis [-p <path>]` and DevAssistant will
    check if the current working directory or path specified
    by `-p` is a git repository with GitHub *remote* specified.
    
    If so, it will allow Travis checks for your project and add
    `.travis.yml` (if not already present) with default content
    for language guessed from `.devassistant`, or blank when
    `.devassistant` is not available.
    
    ### More options:
    
     * `--url` - changes Travis CI URL, default https://travis-ci.org/
